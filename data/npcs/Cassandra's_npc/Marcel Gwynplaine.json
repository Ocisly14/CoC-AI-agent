He once left town for a year or two, boasting that he would make something of himself, but after seeing the wider world he realized his own mediocrity and returned home disillusioned. He worked at a winery until he was fired two months ago. Since then, he has lived a directionless life, drinking heavily and venting his bitterness about social inequality.",
