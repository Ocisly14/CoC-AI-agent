      "age": 45,
      "appearance": "A grotesque hybrid creature born from human flesh and the influence of Shub-Niggurath. Its body shows distorted humanoid features mixed with bestial traits such as claws, hooves, horns, or fangs. The skin is rough and unhealthy, often damp with mud from the forest swamps it inhabits.",

During a failed or excessive ritual, he was transformed into a monstrous servitor known as a Gofern-Hupadego-Shub-Nicholas, doomed to live in the damp forests and swamps as a creature of the Dark Mother.",

      "notes": "Combat & Abilities Notes: Damage Bonus: +0. In combat, a Gofern-Hupadego of Shub-Niggurath may make one attack per round, choosing from a bite or a claw/hoof strike/punch. Some specimens bearing goat or ram horns may instead perform a headbutt. Certain individuals may wield crude clubs or other improvised weapons. Attack Chances: – Claw: 30% – Bite: 40% – Headbutt: 20% – Improvised Weapon: 25% Special Combat Maneuver – Relentless Bite: On a successful bite, the target suffers 1D6 damage and blood drain. Starting from the first round after the bite, the target loses 3D10 STR per round as long as the creature maintains its grip. Armor & Regeneration: The creature has no armor, but regenerates 1D6 HP per round until destroyed. Spells: All Gofern-Hupadego know the spells Call Shub-Niggurath, Summon/Bind Dark Young, Body Transformation, Spirit Transformation, and Crimson Circle, plus 1D5 additional spells chosen by the Keeper. Skills: – Claw 30% (1D6 + damage bonus) – Bite 40% (1D4) – Headbutt 20% (1D6 + damage bonus) – Improvised Weapon 25% (weapon damage + damage bonus) These creatures retain all skills from their former human lives, and additionally gain Hide 90% and Stealth 70%. Sanity Loss: Witnessing most Gofern-Hupadego of Shub-Niggurath causes 0/1D4 SAN loss; witnessing a particularly horrific or heavily mutated specimen causes 1/1D6 SAN loss."
