      "notes": "Combat & Abilities:\n\nCombat Style:\nAlthough cold spiders possess intelligence, they do not cooperate with one another and may even engage in cannibalism. A bite injects deadly venom. Rumors persist of extraordinarily gigantic cold spiders. Each cold spider attacks once per round.\n\nAttacks:\n• Bite – 40%: Deals 1D3 damage plus venom. Venom POT equals 1/5 of the spider’s CON.\n\nCombat Maneuvers:\n• Web Projection – 60% (Entangle): Targets must succeed in a STR vs STR contest to escape. The effective STR of the web equals half the spider’s SIZ.\n\nArmor:\n6 points (thick chitinous shell).\n\nSpells:\nRoll 1D20; if the result is lower than the spider’s INT, the Keeper selects 1D3 spells for the spider to use.\n\nSanity Loss:\nSeeing a cold spider causes SAN loss of 0 / 1D10. Encountering a truly gigantic cold spider increases this to 1 / 1D20.\n\nKeeper Notes:\nDreamlands cold spiders are apex predators and should be treated as major threats rather than minor encounters."
