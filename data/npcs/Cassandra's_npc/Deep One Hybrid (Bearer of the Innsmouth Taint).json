      "age": 0,
      "appearance": "A largely human-looking individual bearing subtle but disturbing aquatic traits: slightly bulging, unblinking eyes; thickened lips; coarse skin; and an unusual body odor reminiscent of the sea. With age, these traits grow more pronounced as the transformation toward a true Deep One progresses.",
      "personality": "Withdrawn, secretive, and inwardly conflicted. Younger hybrids may cling to human identity, while older ones who accept their aquatic heritage become calm, fatalistic, and increasingly alien in outlook.",
      "background": "Deep One hybrids are the descendants of humans tainted by the Innsmouth bloodline. Though born human, they inevitably undergo a gradual transformation into full Deep Ones later in life. Some remain unaware of their heritage for years, while others are raised within communities that normalize or even revere their destiny.",

      "notes": "Combat & Abilities:\n\nCombat Style:\nDeep One hybrids can use standard human weapons and attack once per round.\n\nAttacks:\n• Fighting 45% (22/9): Damage is based on the weapon used plus damage bonus, or unarmed strike for 1D3 + damage bonus.\n\nArmor:\nNone.\n\nSpells:\nOlder hybrids who have begun to accept their aquatic heritage have a 10% chance to know 1D3 spells.\n\nSkills (Racial Tendencies):\n• Stealth 46%\n• Swim 60%\n• Jump 45%\n• Dodge 30% (15/6)\n• Listen 50%\n\nSpecial Ability – Limited Aquatic Endurance:\nBefore fully transforming into Deep Ones, hybrids cannot breathe underwater. However, from early childhood they can hold their breath underwater for up to twice as long as a normal human.\n\nSanity Loss:\nSeeing a Deep One hybrid causes SAN loss of 0 / 1D4. Particularly horrifying individuals may cause increased loss (1 / 1D6 or higher) at the Keeper’s discretion.\n\nKeeper Notes:\nHybrids work best as slow-burn horror elements. Their tragedy lies in inevitability rather than immediate monstrosity, making them effective long-term NPCs or revelations tied to Innsmouth-related investigations."
