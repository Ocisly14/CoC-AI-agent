They attack once per round.\n\nAttacks:\n• Fighting 45% (22/9): Damage is 1D6 + damage bonus, or weapon-dependent (e.g., spear: 1D8 + damage bonus).\n\nArmor:\n1 point (tough skin and scales).\n\nSpells:\nThere is a 40% chance that a Deep One knows 1D4 spells.\n\nSpecial Ability – Amphibious Respiration:\nDeep Ones can breathe underwater naturally and can also breathe on land without limitation.\n\nSanity Loss:\nSeeing a Deep One causes SAN loss of 0 / 1D6.\n\nKeeper Notes:\nDeep Ones function well as disciplined shock troops or as emissaries of vast, ancient oceanic powers. Their true horror lies not only in their appearance but in their timeless patience and inevitable return to claim what is theirs."
