      "occupation": "Former Psychiatrist / Politician",
      "age": 55,
      "gender": "male",
      "appearance": "A reclusive middle-aged to elderly man of German descent. He dresses conservatively and neatly, favoring dark, formal clothing. His demeanor is restrained and distant, giving the impression of a man who prefers solitude and control.",
      "personality": "Cold, calculating, ambitious, and intellectually arrogant. Patrizio believes he understands human nature better than others and sees people primarily as subjects to be studied or controlled. He is patient, manipulative, and deeply convinced of his own righteousness.",
      "background": "Patrizio von Samsa is a German immigrant whose grandfather was among the last nobility of the German Empire and fled to the United States after the November Revolution. Raised with the weight of a lost aristocratic identity, Patrizio received an elite education and became a psychiatrist. In late 1986, he participated in a six-month exchange program in Arkham, Massachusetts. There, he encountered a bizarre psychiatric case involving an Innsmouth native displaying dissociative states, inhuman strength, and unnatural intelligence. This experience fundamentally altered Patrizio’s worldview and set him on a path that eventually led him away from medicine and toward politics, using his psychological expertise to pursue power and influence in Cassandra.",
      "goals": [
        "To gain political power and reshape society according to his understanding of human nature",
        "To continue researching and exploiting abnormal psychological and inhuman phenomena"
      ],
      "secrets": [
        "His interest in psychiatry was driven by a desire to control and experiment on others rather than to heal",
        "His political ambitions are rooted in knowledge gained from unnatural encounters in Arkham",
        "He employs Martin Gin (Ghost Hand) as a hacker and courier, and knows Ghost Hand is the murderer of both the 2002 and 2003 murder cases",
        "He ordered the killing of Lucifero because she intercepted the Borrachero package and was mistakenly identified as the hacker who stole his secrets",
        "He is preparing a ritual to awaken Cthulhu and other Great Old Ones, which will actually summon Ghatanothoa instead"
