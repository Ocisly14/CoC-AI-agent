      "name": "Lux Lynch",
      "occupation": "Police Officer (corrupt)",
      "age": 32,
      "appearance": "An ordinary-looking man who blends easily into the background; usually dressed as a plainclothes police officer, giving off a cautious and somewhat nervous demeanor.",
      "personality": "Pragmatic, fearful, morally compromised, and deeply conflicted. Once idealistic, now cynical and submissive to authority, with traces of a guilty conscience.",
      "background": "Lux Lynch was once a passionate and idealistic young man. In his youth, he and his classmates exposed corporate fraud involving falsified accounts and the use of child labor overseas. The whistleblowing ruined their careers and nearly landed them in legal trouble. Disillusioned, Lux returned to his hometown, became a police officer, and survived by ingratiating himself with his superiors. He gradually became a corrupt cop, taking bribes to handle minor illegal matters. Although he avoids committing truly heinous crimes, he is now trapped by fear and dependence. His superior, Patrizio von Samsa, has begun displaying increasingly strange and inhuman behavior, terrifying Lux but leaving him too compromised to defect.",

        "He planted the folding knife (which belonged to Philip) on Lucifero's body on Martin's orders to confuse the investigation",
        "He transported Lucifero's body to Star Hospital and later to the crematorium under orders",
        "He knows Martin (Ghost Hand) works for the government/Patrizio but doesn't know his true identity",
        "He is terrified of Patrizio's inhuman powers and cannot betray him"
