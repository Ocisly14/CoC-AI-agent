    "notes": "Average Damage Bonus: +2D6.\nCombat Behavior: Atlach-Nacha attacks by kicking with its many legs or slamming enemies with its massive abdomen. Attacks per round: 1.\nCombat – Bite: The bite pierces any normal armor and injects a paralytic toxin. The target must succeed at an Extreme CON roll to resist paralysis for 1D10 rounds, then make a second CON roll. If both rolls succeed, the toxin is resisted; if both fail, the target is paralyzed.\nCombat Maneuver – Web Projection: Targets are wrapped in strong, sticky webs. Escaping requires an opposed STR test against STR 150.\nArmor: 12-point chitin and fur. When reduced to 0 HP, Atlach-Nacha escapes through complex web-tunnels to a secret lair to recover.\nSpells: All Contact (Call/Contact) spells.\nSkills Detail: Fighting 60% (30/12), damage bonus or bite; Web Projection 80% (40/16).\nSanity Loss: Seeing Atlach-Nacha causes 1/1D10 SAN loss.",
