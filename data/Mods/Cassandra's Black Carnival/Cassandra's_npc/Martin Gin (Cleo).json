      "background": "Martin Gin, also known as 'Ghost Hand,' is the third hacker in Cassandra and the murderer of both the 2002 Paradil Hotel murder case and the 2003 Reindeer Bar murder case. He deliberately attracted Patrizio von Samsa's attention and was employed by him under the alias 'Ghost Hand' to handle computer security. Acting as a courier and intermediary, Martin transported goods to the docks and handled sensitive deliveries. Through his work, he assisted Patrizio in seizing the missing businessmen's bank assets in Cassandra. Martin operates under false names and avoids revealing his true identity. He is actually Martin Cleo, son of Sanchez Cleo, and has a vendetta against Ben Cleo, believing Ben was responsible for his father's disappearance.",
