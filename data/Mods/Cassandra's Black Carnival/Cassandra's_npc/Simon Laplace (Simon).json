      "age": 34,
      "appearance": "A lean Caucasian man with a weary expression and unkempt hair. His clothing is often mismatched and worn from constant travel, giving him the look of someone who rarely stays in one place for long.",

After nearly allowing Nancy to be forced into sex work in a red-light district, he intervened at the last moment and took her away. Determined to help her quit gambling and start over, Simon chose a life on the road, traveling across the United States with Nancy. This decision caused deep dissatisfaction and conflict with Anatole, who viewed Simon’s actions as irresponsible and dangerous.",
