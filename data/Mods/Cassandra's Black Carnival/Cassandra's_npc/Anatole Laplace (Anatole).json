    "name": "Anatole Laplace (Anatole)",
    "occupation": "Information Security Engineer / Surveillance System Designer",
    "age": 36,
    "appearance": "A thin, pale man with sharp features and tired eyes. Often dressed in simple shirts and jackets, giving off the impression of a reclusive technician rather than a social figure.",
    "personality": "Coldly rational, controlling, and distrustful. Anatole believes order and control are necessary to survive in a dangerous world. He is intelligent but emotionally rigid, easily frustrated by what he sees as others’ irresponsibility.",
    "background": "Anatole is a highly skilled information security and surveillance systems expert. In 1998, he was recruited via the dark web by two wealthy businessmen seeking to build a secure monitoring system to facilitate their secret sacrificial activities. Anatole designed and implemented the \"Qianwei System,\" a comprehensive surveillance network. He deliberately left a backdoor in the system, allowing himself remote access and approximate geolocation of all monitored sites. When he discovered the system ultimately centered on Cassandra, he relocated there, viewing it as the safest place due to his absolute control over the surveillance infrastructure. Anatole strongly disapproved of Simon’s decision to take Nancy away and live a drifting life, seeing it as reckless.",
    "goals": [
      "Maintain total control over the surveillance system in Cassandra",
      "Ensure his own safety through information dominance"

    "secrets": [
      "He knowingly enabled and protected ritual sacrifice activities by providing surveillance technology",
      "He retains secret backdoor access capable of exposing or sabotaging powerful individuals",
      "He is Simon's alter ego (dissociative identity disorder) - Simon is the host personality",
      "During the 2003 Reindeer Bar incident, he was in control and had an argument with Lucifero (Jenny Florence)",
      "He received a threatening note from Adolph arranging a meeting at the Reindeer Bar on December 22, mentioning the 1988 incident",
      "He hates Black people due to childhood trauma and would use racial slurs",
      "He has a habit of stalking and spying on underage girls, both online and in person",
      "He can easily find evidence of Lux Lynch's corruption and use it to make him talk",
      "He is not interested in stopping Patrizio, only in solving his own problems and getting rid of Nancy"
