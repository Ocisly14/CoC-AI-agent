      "age": 41,
      "appearance": "A sickly-looking middle-aged man with trembling hands, pale complexion, and signs of chronic exhaustion. Often appears sleep-deprived and physically unwell.",

      "background": "Vincent Galenus is the director of the local hospital in Cassandra. Despite his profession, he is far wealthier than his position should allow. In 1999, wealthy patrons involved in occult sacrifices recruited him to analyze a mysterious substance known as 'milk' for potential mass production. Desperate to save his terminally ill wife, Vincent accepted their offer in exchange for money and experimental medicine. After the patrons disappeared in 2002, his wife died. Patrizio later coerced Vincent into assisting with human experimentation to create Cthulhu-related hybrids, promising to resurrect Vincent’s wife as a ghoul. Though wracked with regret, Vincent continued down this path, clinging to the belief that his wife’s revival was worth any cost.",
