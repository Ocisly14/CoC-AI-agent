    "age": 35,
    "appearance": "A tall, slender man with a pale complexion and an unhealthy yet dangerous aura. He is meticulous about his appearance, always dressed in elegant, well-tailored formal wear. He keeps expensive incense and has refined taste in perfumes.",
    "personality": "Calm, elegant, manipulative, highly self-controlled. Enjoys being in control, skilled at concealing emotions and lying when necessary. Cynical toward high society yet obsessed with being accepted by it. Opportunistic and untrustworthy.",
    "background": "Born into a once-wealthy family descended from minor nobility. Studied economics and electronics in university, believing in the future of information industries. His parents were ruined by an Egyptian businessman (an avatar of Nyarlathotep), whose organization seized their assets. Adolph was sent to the United States before completing his studies; his parents later committed suicide in France. While his family was collapsing, he secretly witnessed Anatole murder Nancy's mother in his family home in France (1988). After the rise of the internet, he used his computer skills and gathered secrets to infiltrate elite circles again. In 2002, he came to Cassandra following some leads and obtained the Qianwei System from the basement of the missing businessmen's villa. He stayed in Cassandra to control this powerful surveillance system.",
