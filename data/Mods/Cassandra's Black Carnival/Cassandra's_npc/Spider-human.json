They may attack once per combat round.\n\nAttacks:\n• Hook Claw – 90%: Deals 1d4 + damage bonus.\n• Bite (Special Attack) – 30%: Deals 1d6 damage plus venom. The venom’s POT equals 1/10 of the spider-human’s CON (rounded down).\n\nArmor:\nNone.\n\nSpells:\nNone.\n\nSanity Loss:\nWitnessing the true form of a spider-human beneath its black robes causes SAN loss of 0 / 1d6.\n\nAdditional Notes:\nSpider-humans are former humans transformed through cold spider parasitic infection. Although they retain a roughly human silhouette, their true bodies are heavily mutated, with chitinous growths and predatory appendages. Their behavior is driven by instinct and obedience rather than human morality."
