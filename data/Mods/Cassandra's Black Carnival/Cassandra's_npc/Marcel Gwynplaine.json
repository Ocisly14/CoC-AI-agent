      "name": "Marcel Gwynplaine",
      "occupation": "Unemployed drifter (former winery worker)",
      "age": 30,
      "appearance": "A scruffy man wearing an old, worn-out denim jacket. He looks unkempt and tired, with the appearance of someone who drinks heavily and neglects personal care.",
      "personality": "Petty, resentful, and prone to complaining. Marcel likes to blame society for his failures, but beneath his constant grumbling he is timid and cowardly, easily frightened when real danger appears.",
      "background": "Marcel was born and raised in Cassandra. He once left town for a year or two, boasting that he would make something of himself, but after seeing the wider world he realized his own mediocrity and returned home disillusioned. He worked at a winery until he was fired two months ago. Since then, he has lived a directionless life, drinking heavily and venting his bitterness about social inequality.",
      "goals": [
        "Find a way to survive day to day without real work",
        "Ventr his resentment and frustrations on others"
      ],
      "secrets": [
        "He witnessed a man with a distinctive scar/ birthmark emerging from the sewer on Crescent Street B around December 17 (this was Martin checking Lucifero's hideout)",
        "He saw the victim (Lucifero) making a phone call in the restroom before she was killed",
        "He saw a man in formal wear (Adolph) passing by on the way to the restroom, but the lighting was too dim to be certain",
        "He discovered that the waiter mixed up the drink orders - he received Lucifero's expensive drink, and Lucifero's drink contained strong hallucinogenic drugs (which he didn't report to avoid trouble)",
        "He had seen the victim before - earlier that afternoon at the bar, a tall slender man bumped into her and they had an argument",
        "He was THE FIRST PERSON to discover the victim's body in the restroom - when he went to use the restroom, he noticed the women's restroom door was open, saw blood flowing out, pushed the door open and found the victim's body. However, he was afraid of being implicated and pretended not to see anything, trying to leave quietly. Philip's shouting caught him before he could escape"

      "notes": "Marcel is a key witness to the 2003 Reindeer Bar murder case. CRITICALLY: He was THE FIRST PERSON to discover the victim's body in the restroom - when he went to use the restroom, he noticed the women's restroom door was open, saw blood flowing out, pushed the door open and found the victim's body. However, he was afraid of being implicated and pretended not to see anything, trying to leave quietly. Philip Scaletta noticed Marcel's nervous expression, went to check the restroom, also discovered the body, and shouted - making Philip the first person to publicly discover and report the body. Marcel also witnessed several important details: Martin emerging from the sewer on December 17, the victim making a phone call before death, and Adolph passing by. He also discovered the drink order mix-up that revealed the hallucinogenic drugs. However, he is easily intimidated and may not reveal all information unless pressured. He is more useful as a nervous witness and atmospheric NPC than as a reliable source of information."
