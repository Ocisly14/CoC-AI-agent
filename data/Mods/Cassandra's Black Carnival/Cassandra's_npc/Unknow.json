She was not a local resident of Cassandra, so no missing person report exists. She came to Cassandra to investigate the disappearance of her younger sister, who ran away from home. Evidence indicates that her sister's last known destination was Cassandra. Her body was discovered in a cold storage unit in the hotel kitchen's basement, completely naked and encased in a large block of ice. The body showed no wounds. She had no identification documents and no relatives could be found. The case was quickly shelved and became a cold case.",
