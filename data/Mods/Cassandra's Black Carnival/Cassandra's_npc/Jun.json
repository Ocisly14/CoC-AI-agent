      "background": "Jun is a little-known university professor specializing in history and literature, with a strong fascination for strange phenomena and obscure stories. He is notoriously bad with directions. He asked Lyn to drive him and Wind around the outskirts of Cassandra to collect local folklore and material. During this trip, Jun disappeared near the incinerator. Lyn never left the car, and when she went searching after waiting too long, she only found Wind, who had suddenly gone insane. No one knows that Jun sacrificed himself in his final moments to ensure Wind could escape alive.",
