      "age": 35,
      "gender": "female",
      "appearance": "An elegant and composed woman, often seen wearing a distinctive ruby brooch gifted by her adoptive father. Her attire is formal and professional, reflecting her status as a capable lawyer.",
      "personality": "Intelligent, diligent, and conscientious. She carries a sense of guilt toward her benefactor and is driven by a desire to prove her worth, while remaining unaware of the darker forces surrounding her upbringing.",
      "background": "Lucia Shiny, known as Mrs. Barklyite or 'the Red Stone Lady,' was an orphan from the slums with no knowledge of her biological parents. She was adopted by Albert Shiny, who ran an orphanage and secretly was a Shoggoth Lord. Although his true intention was to increase the human population for predation, Lucia believed his motives were benevolent. She grew up to become a highly capable lawyer, though she feels she has not lived up to her adoptive father's expectations.",

      "She is unaware that her adoptive father is a non-human entity with horrific motives",
      "Her upbringing was part of a larger, inhuman scheme rather than an act of pure charity",

      "She knows 'Shore Master' (Adolph Carl) and conducted business with Lucifero through him",
      "She asked Lucifero to intercept some of the Borrachero that Lux was transporting to the hospital",
      "She is skilled in disguise and can help investigators if they gain her trust",
      "The ruby brooch she wears comes from moon-beasts in the Dreamlands, and her adoptive father can exchange her through it if she becomes useless"
