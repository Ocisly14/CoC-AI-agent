      "background": "Solomon is considered a descendant of Native Americans under the 'one-drop blood rule.' From a young age, he showed a strong interest in mysticism and appeared to possess some magical aptitude, particularly precognitive abilities. However, as he grew older, these abilities faded and are currently dormant. He habitually spends any money he has on books related to the occult, though he often ends up being deceived by unreliable sellers. Before coming to Cassandra, Solomon purchased a myth-related book connected to real occult lore—'The King in Yellow'—which contains no spells but is tied to genuine mythos knowledge.",
