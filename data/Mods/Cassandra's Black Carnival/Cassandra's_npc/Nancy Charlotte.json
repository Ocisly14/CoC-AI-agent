      "occupation": "Florist / Flower Shop Assistant",
      "age": 22,
      "appearance": "A sweet and delicate young woman with a doll-like face and long golden curly hair reaching her hips. When seen by investigators, she is wearing a red woolen coat. While tending flowers, her focused and gentle demeanor gives her an almost angelic impression.",
      "personality": "Pure-hearted, kind, gentle, and emotionally vulnerable. Despite her traumatic upbringing, she remains sincere, trusting, and compassionate. She is easily hurt but capable of deep attachment and loyalty.",
      "background": "Nancy was born from a brief romance between parents of different nationalities during a vacation in Turkey. After her parents divorced when she was five, she was taken to France by her mother. Her mother later married a wealthy man who sexually harassed Nancy in secret; when Nancy told her mother, she was told to endure it for the sake of comfort. Eventually, Nancy was sent to a boarding school, where she met Simon Laplace, who became her first true friend. Her mother later joined the Black Goat cult and attempted to sacrifice Nancy. This led to a tragic train accident in France, followed by a violent confrontation in which Nancy’s mother was killed by Anatole, Simon’s alternate personality. Nancy was then taken to America by Simon and has since lived under constant threat from cult remnants.",

      "She paid her debt to Lucifero (Jenny Florence) who came to collect the money, but some photos are still missing",
      "She has a tattoo on her arm that she tries to hide",
      "If she dies from the spider infection, Simon will collapse and disappear, leaving only Anatole"
