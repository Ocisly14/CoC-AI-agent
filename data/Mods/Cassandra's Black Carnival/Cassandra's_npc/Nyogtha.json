      "appearance": "An immense, amorphous mass of cold, gelatinous substance, riddled with countless minute fissures.

Wherever Nyogtha appears, the ground collapses inward, forming a gateway to a lightless abyss beneath the earth.",

Nyogtha’s composition makes damage bonus irrelevant.\n\nCombat: If Nyogtha intends to cause harm, all enemies within 10 yards automatically suffer 1D10 damage per round from countless tiny wounds. Nyogtha may also seize a victim and drag them into the subterranean abyss unless repelled or banished by appropriate magic. Nyogtha attacks once per round.\n\nArmor: Each round, the first 10 points of damage inflicted by any means are ignored. When reduced to 0 HP, Nyogtha is banished from the material world rather than destroyed.\n\nSpells: All Call and Contact spells; Create Gate.\n\nSanity Loss: Seeing Nyogtha causes a SAN loss of 1D6/1D20.\n\nNyogtha’s attributes exceed normal Call of Cthulhu limits and represent a cosmic-scale entity rather than a conventional opponent."
