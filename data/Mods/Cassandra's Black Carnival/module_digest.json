  "title": "Cassandra's Black Carnival",
  "background": "The module takes place in Cassandra, California, a small American town with a dark history. In 1860, the K'n-yan abandoned their mining operations here, leaving underground structures. During the 1860-1880 westward expansion, Deep One hybrids and Tcho-Tcho immigrants sealed dangerous underground areas and built a human settlement. In 1885, the Cleo crime family arrived from New Orleans, and their leader Fred Cleo accidentally made contact with Nyogtha, establishing a contract that bound his descendants. The town became a nexus of cosmic horror: Mayor Padrich seeks to awaken Cthulhu, Father Constantine attempts to bring Atlach-Nacha, and various other forces with conflicting agendas operate in the shadows. The immediate events begin with two murders: on December 22, 2002, a 19-year-old Black girl's body was found in a freezer at Paradil Grand Hotel, a case that was quickly shelved. On December 22, 2003, another similar murder occurred at Reindeer Bar when a girl who escaped from a freezer came to the bar for help but was killed in the restroom. Detective Bruno Galilei, who had been investigating the first case despite lack of official support, called in his old friends (the investigators) to help solve the second case, believing the murders were connected. However, Bruno dies mysteriously shortly after the investigators arrive, leaving them to uncover the truth behind his death and the murders.",
  "storyOutline": "December 25, 2003, 21:00: Investigators arrive at Cassandra train station, met by Bruno. Bruno explains the two murder cases and drives them through town, stopping at Shandra's shop. They proceed to Reindeer Bar where suspects are gathered for questioning: Ben Cleo (mafia boss), Adolph Carl, Marcel Gwynplaine, Simon Laplace, and Philip Scaletta. Bruno shows evidence and allows investigators to examine it overnight. After questioning suspects, Bruno leaves and is later found dead, drained with unnatural bite wounds. Investigators must piece together clues from NPCs, locations, and evidence. Key locations include Reindeer Bar (crime scene), Paradil Grand Hotel (first murder site), police station (controlled by Mayor Padrich), church (Father Constantine's domain), crematorium (Shoggoth lair), deep forest (monster territory), and various NPC residences. The investigation is nonlinear - clues come from conversations, not physical searches. NPCs have conflicting motives: some are cultists, some are trying to escape cosmic forces, some are protecting secrets. Mayor Padrich's ritual to awaken Cthulhu will complete at New Year's, opening a gateway that will destroy the town in a temporal loop. Investigators must uncover the truth, potentially stop the ritual, and survive the various threats before time runs out.",
  "moduleNotes": "Designed for 3-7 investigators. Required skills: Spot Hidden, Library Use, and at least one investigator with Medicine (essential). Combat and social skills (Persuade, Psychology, Intimidate, Fast Talk) are highly recommended. Additional useful skills: Psychoanalysis, Disguise, and other skills fitting character backgrounds. Character creation restrictions: No hackers, police officers, or programmers allowed. All investigators must be friends of NPC Bruno Galilei, having worked together in a failed detective agency years ago. At least one investigator must arrive by train. Investigators have never been to Cassandra before. Consider American social context, California law, and character backgrounds. The module is nonlinear and open-world - there is no fixed route. Clues are not isolated; investigators must piece together information from multiple sources. NPCs may require multiple interactions to reveal all information. Physical evidence is limited; most truth lies in NPC secrets and motivations. Time pressure: The adventure must conclude before New Year's when Padrich's ritual completes, or investigators will be trapped in the temporal loop. Safety warnings: The module involves murder, cosmic horror, body horror, cult activities, and potentially disturbing themes. Content warnings for violence, death, and supernatural horror.",

  "moduleLimitations": "Time limit: The adventure must conclude before New Year's(Day 8 0:00) when Mayor Padrich's ritual completes, or investigators will be trapped in the temporal destruction loop.",

  "introduction": "On Christmas Eve, Cassandra is ablaze with lights, yet the festive mood feels forced and hollow. The Reindeer Bar's entrance is decorated, and light spills from its windows onto the wet street like a half-hearted holiday performance. When you push open the door, the music and laughter inside pause for a brief moment, then resume as if nothing happened, leaving only a few wary glances lingering on you.\n\nYour arrival here is no accident. Just days ago, your mutual old friend—Bruno—reached out to you. This man, always independent and never one to ask for help easily, spoke with restrained urgency in his message, unable to fully hide his anxiety. He didn't say much over the phone, only that he had encountered something \"too much for one person to handle\" and hoped you could come to Cassandra as soon as possible. You understand that Bruno wouldn't have made this request unless he was truly desperate.\n\nNow, he stands in the bar, gesturing for you to sit at a relatively quiet corner. Pleasantries are brief; he quickly gets to the point. Bruno tells you that this didn't start tonight. A year ago, on December 22nd, at the Paradil Grand Hotel in Cassandra, a body was discovered in a freezer in the kitchen basement—a Black girl, approximately nineteen years old. The manner of concealment and the scene itself were clearly abnormal, but the case was quickly shelved. He had tried to request further investigation, but was refused by his superiors. The case was closed in official records, but he could never accept that outcome.\n\nAs he says this, his gaze involuntarily sweeps across the bar's interior. Just three days ago, also on December 22nd, a young girl escaped from some freezer, running in panic into this Reindeer Bar seeking help. She claimed she had been imprisoned and only wanted to change her clothes. However, on her way to the restroom, she was murdered. Bruno arrived at the scene immediately. He tells you that when he saw what had happened, he instantly realized—the similarities between these two cases were too obvious to ignore.\n\nHe doesn't state the conclusion directly, but his judgment is written on his face: the freezers, the same date, the ignored victims, and the cold, repetitive method. In his view, this cannot be mere coincidence. He suspects it's the work of the same killer, and that this person has been active in Cassandra for more than a year. Bruno has reported the situation truthfully, but the response remains cold—no additional resources, no support whatsoever.\n\nSo, he has no choice but to press forward. Using his authority, he has called several people whose timelines, locations, and behavioral patterns raise questions to this bar for a second round of questioning. Bruno looks at you, his tone growing more somber. He admits frankly that this is no longer a \"compliant\" investigation. He's not asking for help as a police officer, but as an old friend, hoping you can help him observe, question, and judge—to dig out the truth before he's forced to stop.\n\nThe music in the bar continues, and holiday lights flicker on the glass. But you all understand clearly: from the moment you stepped into this Reindeer Bar, you've been drawn into a case that no one wants to investigate deeply. And now, the choice lies before you. May you survive long enough to uncover the truth."
