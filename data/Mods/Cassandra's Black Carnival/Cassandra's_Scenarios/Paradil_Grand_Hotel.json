A 19-year-old Black girl was found dead in a freezer in the hotel kitchen's basement, her body completely naked and encased in a massive block of ice. The case was never fully investigated and never developed into a formal missing person case. The body has long since been removed and processed. Bruno arranges for investigators to stay here after questioning suspects at the Reindeer Bar. Around 2 AM, investigators will be attacked by two masked assailants.",
