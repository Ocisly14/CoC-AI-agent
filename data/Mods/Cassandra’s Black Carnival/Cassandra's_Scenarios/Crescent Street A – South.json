Unlike the northern section, it lacks residential or commercial buildings and feels intentionally restrained. The street primarily serves as an approach to the local police station, reinforcing its official and controlled character.",

Foot traffic is rare, and most passersby appear to be officers or individuals with official business. The atmosphere feels tense but contained, as though the area is constantly under quiet surveillance. Conversations are hushed, and lingering attracts subtle attention.",
