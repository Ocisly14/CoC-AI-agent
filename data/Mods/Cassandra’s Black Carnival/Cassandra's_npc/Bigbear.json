      "appearance": "A very large, muscular man with an intimidating build. Thick neck, broad shoulders, and a rough, weathered look. His physical presence alone is enough to make most people think twice before provoking him.",
      "personality": "Loyal, straightforward, protective of friends, and action-oriented. Not very talkative, but dependable and decisive when violence or danger arises.",
      "background": "Bigbear is part of a close-knit group of friends including Reid, Hawthorne, Lily, Lyn, Jun, Wind, and Solomon.

In 2003, they traveled to Cassandra together during Christmas to accompany Wind, who was about to get married, and to visit his fiancée Isabela. Bigbear has practical experience with violence and protection work, making him the group’s de facto muscle.",
