      "background": "Isaiah Arbar arrived in Cassandra six years ago with fellow businessman David Campbell to invest and conduct business. Both men were drawn into the influence of their wives, who were members of the transatlantic cult known as the Black Goat Cult. Initially horrified by the cult’s rituals, Isaiah’s perspective changed after participating in a blasphemous ceremony and consuming the ‘milk’ of the Dark Mother, which granted him youth, strength, and beauty. Together with David, he profited enormously by commodifying this source. In 2002, during a ritual, Isaiah was transformed into a monstrous being known as a Gof’n-Hupadgo of Shub-Niggurath and disappeared from public view.",
