  "title": "Cassandra's Black Carnival",
  "background": "The module takes place in Cassandra, California, a small American town with a dark history. In 1860, the K'n-yan abandoned their mining operations here, leaving underground structures. During the 1860-1880 westward expansion, Deep One hybrids and Tcho-Tcho immigrants sealed dangerous underground areas and built a human settlement. In 1885, the Cleo crime family arrived from New Orleans, and their leader Fred Cleo accidentally made contact with Nyogtha, establishing a contract that bound his descendants. The town became a nexus of cosmic horror: Mayor Padrich seeks to awaken Cthulhu, Father Constantine attempts to bring Atlach-Nacha, and various other forces with conflicting agendas operate in the shadows. The immediate events begin with two murders: on December 22, 2002, a 19-year-old Black girl's body was found in a freezer at Paradil Grand Hotel, a case that was quickly shelved. On December 22, 2003, another similar murder occurred at Reindeer Bar when a girl who escaped from a freezer came to the bar for help but was killed in the restroom. Detective Bruno Galilei, who had been investigating the first case despite lack of official support, called in his old friends (the investigators) to help solve the second case, believing the murders were connected. However, Bruno dies mysteriously shortly after the investigators arrive, leaving them to uncover the truth behind his death and the murders.",
  "storyOutline": "December 25, 2003, 21:00: Investigators arrive at Cassandra train station, met by Bruno. Bruno explains the two murder cases and drives them through town, stopping at Shandra's shop. They proceed to Reindeer Bar where suspects are gathered for questioning: Ben Cleo (mafia boss), Adolph Carl, Marcel Gwynplaine, Simon Laplace, and Philip Scaletta. Bruno shows evidence and allows investigators to examine it overnight. After questioning suspects, Bruno leaves and is later found dead, drained with unnatural bite wounds. Investigators must piece together clues from NPCs, locations, and evidence. Key locations include Reindeer Bar (crime scene), Paradil Grand Hotel (first murder site), police station (controlled by Mayor Padrich), church (Father Constantine's domain), crematorium (Shoggoth lair), deep forest (monster territory), and various NPC residences. The investigation is nonlinear - clues come from conversations, not physical searches. NPCs have conflicting motives: some are cultists, some are trying to escape cosmic forces, some are protecting secrets. Mayor Padrich's ritual to awaken Cthulhu will complete at New Year's, opening a gateway that will destroy the town in a temporal loop. Investigators must uncover the truth, potentially stop the ritual, and survive the various threats before time runs out.",
  "moduleNotes": "Designed for 3-7 investigators. Required skills: Spot Hidden, Library Use, and at least one investigator with Medicine (essential). Combat and social skills (Persuade, Psychology, Intimidate, Fast Talk) are highly recommended. Additional useful skills: Psychoanalysis, Disguise, and other skills fitting character backgrounds. Character creation restrictions: No hackers, police officers, or programmers allowed. All investigators must be friends of NPC Bruno Galilei, having worked together in a failed detective agency years ago. At least one investigator must arrive by train. Investigators have never been to Cassandra before. Consider American social context, California law, and character backgrounds. The module is nonlinear and open-world - there is no fixed route. Clues are not isolated; investigators must piece together information from multiple sources. NPCs may require multiple interactions to reveal all information. Physical evidence is limited; most truth lies in NPC secrets and motivations. Time pressure: The adventure must conclude before New Year's when Padrich's ritual completes, or investigators will be trapped in the temporal loop. Safety warnings: The module involves murder, cosmic horror, body horror, cult activities, and potentially disturbing themes. Content warnings for violence, death, and supernatural horror.",
  "keeperGuidance": "This is a nonlinear, open-world module with no fixed route. Story development depends on player choices. Adjust encounters, clues, and events based on investigator actions and timing. No encounter needs to be avoided - feel free to expand the story in interesting directions. Describe the world in detail, using images or materials when helpful. If players focus too much on irrelevant details, subtly guide them back through in-game means (NPC actions, plot developments) rather than out-of-game suggestions. Clues and encounters are not fixed - they can occur at any time and place the Keeper chooses, adjusted based on investigator situation. Don't hesitate to give appropriate negative consequences for player actions if deserved and logical, but avoid simply destroying characters and removing player agency. If investigators use overly violent or clumsy methods, NPCs may investigate, pursue, or attack them. Maintain pacing and threat - if investigators progress too quickly, add complications: ambiguous clues, unexpected encounters, dramatic reversals, or unanticipated dangers. Use Idea rolls when players are stuck to provide hints and break deadlocks (Idea is for clue hints, not psychic powers - use POW for mental abilities). The ending is not fixed - create an appropriate conclusion based on investigator performance, fairly evaluating what they gained and lost in their confrontation with cosmic horror. Most secrets are not in locked rooms or safes - they exist in the desires and thoughts of people connected to Cassandra's corruption. Focus on dramatic NPCs, their secrets, and motivations. NPCs have contact points that create interaction and complicate the adventure. The provided information is a skeleton - feel free to add or remove details to create scenes you and players enjoy, and work together to create your own ending.",
  "storyHook": "You receive a call from your old friend Bruno Galilei, a police detective in a small California town called Cassandra. Bruno is the most independent and self-reliant person you know - he never asks for help. If he's reaching out, something serious must have happened. He explains that on December 22nd, a young Black woman was murdered at Reindeer Bar, and he believes it's connected to an unsolved case from exactly one year ago. The authorities aren't taking it seriously, but Bruno believes every life deserves justice. He needs your help. You and your old friends from the detective agency you once ran together agree to come. It's been years since you all worked together, and this might finally be the reunion you've been meaning to have. You arrive at Cassandra train station on December 25th, around 9 PM. The station is old and rusted, with only one platform. Bruno meets you there, looking tired but determined. He's clearly been under pressure. After a brief reunion, he says there's not much time for catching up - he's gathered several suspects at the crime scene, Reindeer Bar, and needs your help questioning them. As you follow him through the old streets of this small town, decorated for Christmas but somehow oppressive, you realize this won't be the peaceful holiday reunion you'd hoped for. Something is very wrong in Cassandra, and Bruno's life may depend on finding the truth quickly.",
  "moduleLimitations": "Time limit: The adventure must conclude before New Year's when Mayor Padrich's ritual completes, or investigators will be trapped in the temporal destruction loop. No fixed investigation route exists - the module is completely nonlinear. Investigators cannot access certain areas without proper triggers or information. The police station is controlled by Mayor Padrich through Lux Lynch - any conflict there is unwise and may result in official action against investigators. The crematorium contains Shoggoths that will awaken if disturbed by noise - quiet investigation is required there. Martin Gin (Ghost Hand) will attack investigators if exposed before they have sufficient truth or support, and defeating him results in endless pursuit in Cassandra. Physical evidence is limited - most information comes from NPC interactions. Investigators cannot simply search locations to find all secrets - they must engage with NPCs multiple times and piece together clues. The module does not guarantee a happy ending - investigators may fail to save people, may not bring Bruno's killers to justice, or may not survive. The scope is bounded to Cassandra and immediate surrounding areas. Certain cosmic entities and forces are beyond direct confrontation - investigators must work around them rather than directly fighting.",

  "introduction": "The train pulls into Cassandra station long after dark on Christmas Day, 2003. The platform is old, rusted, and nearly empty - just a few benches and a single platform. The air is cold, and despite the Christmas decorations visible in the distance, there's something oppressive about this place. Your old friend Bruno is waiting for you, looking more tired and strained than you've ever seen him. He's always been the strong one, the one who helped everyone else. To see him like this, to hear him ask for help when he never does - it tells you everything you need to know about how serious this is. He greets you warmly, but there's no time for the reunion you'd all been planning. A young woman was murdered three days ago at a bar called Reindeer Bar, and Bruno believes it's connected to another killing exactly one year before. The authorities don't care - the victims were Black, and in this small California town, that seems to be enough reason to look the other way. But Bruno cares. He's gathered suspects at the crime scene and needs your help. As you follow him through the old, muddy streets of Cassandra, past shops and Christmas lights that somehow feel wrong, you realize this town holds secrets darker than a simple murder case. Something ancient and terrible has been stirring here for over a century, and your friend's determination to find justice may have drawn the attention of forces that don't belong in this world. Welcome to Cassandra. May you survive long enough to uncover the truth.",
  "characterGuidance": "Create investigators who are all friends of NPC Bruno Galilei, having worked together in a failed private detective agency around 1995. The agency collapsed due to poor business management despite good intentions. After it closed, Bruno became a police detective in Cassandra while other investigators pursued their own careers. They remained friends but haven't all been together in years. Suitable occupations include: private investigator, journalist, doctor or medical professional (highly recommended - at least one is essential), lawyer, academic researcher, librarian, social worker, or other professions that would fit former detective agency partners. Avoid: hacker, police officer, programmer, or any tech-focused roles that involve coding. Skills should emphasize investigation (Spot Hidden, Library Use essential), social interaction (Persuade, Psychology, Fast Talk, Intimidate), and at least one character with Medicine. Combat skills are useful but not primary. Consider skills that fit your character's background and help with exploration and social interaction. Characters should be motivated by friendship with Bruno and a sense of justice, willing to help solve murders that authorities have ignored. Consider how your character would react to discovering cosmic horror and whether they have any relevant knowledge or connections that might help. At least one investigator must arrive by train. All investigators are new to Cassandra and unfamiliar with the town."
