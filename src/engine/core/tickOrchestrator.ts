// src/engine/core/tickOrchestrator.ts
//
// Tick driver for the tool-driven action engine (plan Phase 8). One tick, in
// order:
//
//   1  drain the command inbox at the clock the actors decided on
//   2  (conditional) the START JUDGEMENT — the Engine's first function, one
//       session over that same minute: clock, bar and route for every new
//       command, committed as active from that minute; no commands → no call
//   3  advance the clock
//   4  advance deterministic movement runtimes (a walk that just started
//       takes its first step; blocked → interruption); spend the minute on
//       every active action
//   5  collect settlement triggers (due / replacement / interrupted)
//   6  (conditional) the SETTLEMENT — the Engine's second function, one
//       session over the new minute; no triggers → no call
//   8  anchor subsystems + scripted events (unchanged relative order)
//   11 single Applier flush (StateChanges + settlement WorldDeltas)
//   12 commit the settlement's lifecycle transitions, emit TickReport
//
// A command is judged the minute its actor decided it. The actor perceived
// the world at 09:00 and acted; the start judgement runs on that 09:00 world
// before the clock moves, so `startedAt` is 09:00 and the minute to 09:01 is
// the first minute spent on it. A one-minute action — plain talk, a short
// walk — is therefore due at 09:01 and settled in that same tick, its words
// delivered in that tick's occurrences. Measured before this: a spoken line
// took two ticks to be heard, and the speaker, asked to decide again in
// between and told nothing of the words still in their mouth, answered the
// same question twice.
//
// There is no queued-step activation, no plannedOutcome commit, no cancel
// re-resolve: replacement and interruption are settled by the Engine on the
// same snapshot as everything else that ends.
