// src/engine/resolution/worldResolutionStageSchemas.ts
//
// The six phase tools of the World Action Engine, one per domain, offered to
// the model one at a time. The Engine has two functions, each a session of
// its own with its own world context:
//
//   the start judgement — one phase, `starts` — run the minute a command
//   arrives, before any world time has passed on it;
//   the settlement — `endings → characterChanges → itemChanges → sceneChanges
//   → occurrences` — run when actions end.
//
// Each tool takes ONE required top-level array and nothing else. That is the
// whole point of the split. The retired arrangement was two terminal tools
// called together in one turn — an `starting`+`ending` half that compiled
// strict, and an effects half carrying all 19 `anyOf` branches of the three
// operation unions at once, which the Anthropic grammar compiler refuses; that
// half therefore shipped unconstrained, and its contract was left to prose and
// to the validator. Cut the same six arrays into six requests and each one is
// small enough to compile — the operation unions arrive at 7, 8 and 4 branches
// instead of 19 together, and every phase can ask for `strict: true`.
//
// Nothing here restates an element shape. Five of the six arrays ARE the
// objects `worldDeltaSchema.ts` defines (`STARTING_LIST` and friends), so the
// row shape the model is shown and the row shape the validator judges come from
// one table and cannot drift apart. The sixth — endings — is deliberately its
// own schema: see ENDING_DECISION_ITEM.
