# Languages guidance

Use for reading, writing, speaking, translating, and interpreting — foreign
tongues, dead tongues, dialects, jargon, and specialized registers.

This domain has no single value. A character carries a list of tongues: the
ones they grew up in, and the ones they learned, each with its own fluency.
The command names which one is in play (`declaredLanguage`), and code rolls
that language's number.

## A native tongue is never checked

Nobody rolls to speak the language they think in. A declaration of Languages for a native tongue is removed at intake,
leaving no language check; an independently declared applicable skill such
as Social is still checked, and
that is correct — settle it on its merits like any other unskilled action.
Do not reach for a bar because speech was involved.

What a native speaker can still fail at is not the language: persuading
(Social), noticing a slip (Investigation), knowing what the words mean in
their field (Knowledge & Craft, Science & Nature, Occult). Check that instead,
if the actor declared it.

## Applicability

- Accepted for translation, comprehension of speech or text, using a learned tongue, and decoding unfamiliar linguistic terminology —
  always in a NAMED language the actor has learned.
- Rejected for what the text MEANS in its field once translated — that is
  Knowledge & Craft, Science & Nature, or Occult by subject.
- A tongue the character does not have never reaches you: the boundary
  refuses it, because that is not a harder attempt but an impossible one.
- Fluency is the actor's number and is not yours to set. What you set is the
  difficulty of THIS passage: condition of the text, archaism, dialect, noise,
  speed of speech, how much hangs on precision.

Only supplied readable text or speech already delivered can be translated or
understood. Pending speech and hidden text are not sources. A private reading
is not automatically heard or understood by nearby people.

## Success levels

- **Regular** — The gist, reliably: the actor knows what is being said or
  asked, with rough edges and gaps.
- **Hard** — Accurate and complete, including idiom, register, and what the
  phrasing implies about the speaker or writer.
- **Extreme** — Subtle distinctions supported by the supplied text or delivered
  speech. An accent may suggest a region but does not establish a speaker's
  identity or hidden intention.

## Failure

- Not understood, or understood so partially it cannot be acted on. Time is
  spent on the passage.
- **Fumble** — A mistranslation or linguistic error may result. Distinguish
  the erroneous analysis from the original meaning; do not force belief or
  invent an offended listener. Code delivers a command's utterance verbatim:
  a failed check never authorizes rewriting those words. Describe only supported
  delivery or comprehension limitations, without changing quoted text.

## State surface

Typical deltas this domain produces. Not a requirement and never a substitute
for what actually happened — a one-off descriptive result is occurrence
`content`, not a state change.

- Usually NOTHING. Understanding is occurrence `content`, with the reader or
  listener in `perceivers` at `full`.
- `item.create` — a written translation or transcription that now exists;
  `item.set` when the actor annotates the original.
- An audible register or fluent delivery is an occurrence only to those
  who actually perceive it — what they now make of the speaker is
  theirs to write, not yours to assert.
