# Combat Rules (LLM Ready)

## What counts as Combat
- Combat = actions aimed at harming, neutralizing, or immediately avoiding harm; violent stakes in the next moments.
- Treat as Combat: melee/ranged/throw attacks; dodging or fighting back; grapples/disarms/shoves; fleeing or chasing during a fight; using cover/weapons/shields mid-fight.
- Not Combat: pre-conflict stealth; negotiations to avert conflict (Social); observing a battlefield without engaging (Exploration); unopposed movement in a safe area.
- Quick test: if someone could be hurt in the next second, use Combat.

## When to roll
- Combat actions almost always roll because outcomes are uncertain and high-stakes.
- Rare no-roll: unresisted execution; purely narrative cleanup after a fight ends.
- Otherwise every attack/defense/tactical maneuver requires a roll.
- Push is not allowed in Combat; risk is already immediate damage.

## Core resolution patterns (CoC 7e)
- Melee opposed: attacker vs defender; defender chooses `Dodge` or `Fight Back`.
- Ranged: attacker rolls Firearms; defender cannot counter, only dive for cover (`Dodge` with penalty dice).
- Fighting Maneuvers: goal is state change (disarm, grapple, knockdown, pin) rather than direct damage.

## Outcomes
- Success: deal damage, alter target state (prone, controlled), gain tactical edge (position, suppression), force retreat/surrender.
- Failure: take damage, get knocked down/incapacitated, expose yourself to fire, become surrounded/suppressed.
- Consequences apply immediately: HP loss, Major Wound, unconscious/dying, SAN checks versus horrors when relevant.

## Time structure
- Uses Combat Rounds: enough time for everyone to take one significant combat action (a few seconds).
- Think in layers: instantaneous reactions (dodge/fight back inside others' turns); one-round actions (attack, move, swap weapon); the entire battle is multiple rounds resolved in order.

## Common modifiers/conditions
- DEX order (firearms act at DEX+50), being outnumbered, range bands (melee/point-blank/long), cover, major wounds or impairments.
- These produce bonus/penalty dice or limit available actions.

## Relevant skills
- Core: Fighting (Brawl or weapon specialty), Dodge, Firearms (Handgun/Rifle/etc.).
- Related: Throw for thrown weapons; Stealth for ambush entry only; First Aid after combat; Intimidate for in-combat threat if Keeper allows.
- Attributes: DEX for order/dodges; STR for melee/grapples; CON for enduring damage; POW for resisting mental control or fear.
