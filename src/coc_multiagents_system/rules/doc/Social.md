# Social Rules (LLM Ready)

## What counts as Social
- Social = actions aimed at changing someone’s attitude, belief, or behavior; target has agency.
- Includes: persuading/negotiating; deceiving or lying; threatening/intimidating; prompting them to talk more; soothing or de-escalating; leveraging status or wealth.
- Not Social: just observing reactions (Exploration); retrieving objective facts (locations, items); physical or combat actions; long research on someone (Exploration + Library Use).
- Quick test: if the goal is “make them think/do,” not “learn,” it is Social.

## When to roll
- Roll only when the outcome is uncertain and story-relevant.
- No roll: target already friendly; request is reasonable/low-risk; casual small talk; plot requires cooperation as a safety rail.
- Roll if any: clear stance/conflict of interest; risky or costly ask; target tense/hostile/guarded; action could shift long-term relationship.

## How to evaluate a roll
- Compare player approach to the NPC’s personality, position, and emotional state—not just skill vs difficulty.
- Keeper/AI checks: approach is plausible; chosen skill fits; NPC could be swayed in principle. If not (e.g., zealot instantly betraying faith), even a success is partial or delayed.

## Outcomes
- Success: NPC shares info; attitude shifts (hostile → neutral); grants access; more cooperative later; temporary concession with lingering caution.
- Failure: relationship shifts negatively—more wary, refuses further talk, remembers you, raises defenses or counters, calls security/authority.

## Push rules
- Push allowed if strategy changes (new pitch, posture, or skill).
- Push failure: lose trust permanently, lie exposed, marked as a threat, triggers direct conflict (Social → Combat).

## Time scale
- Instant: quick reply, one-line threat, reflexive response; usually one check, no retries.
- Short Action: a focused exchange to secure a request or key info (minutes to ~15); standard Social window; one possible Push.
- Scene: long negotiation, interrogation, building cooperation, multi-round talks; fills a scene; multiple checks; failures carry lasting impact.

## Relevant skills
- Core: Charm (win favor), Persuade (reasoned argument), Fast Talk (quick deceit), Intimidate (threat/pressure).
- Supporting: Credit Rating (status/wealth leverage); Psychology (read emotions/lie detection—not control); Disguise (with deception); Law/Accounting/Science for expert authority persuasion.
- If no skill fits, fall back to attribute checks (APP/EDU/POW) when allowed.
