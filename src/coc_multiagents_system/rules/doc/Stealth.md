# Stealth Rules (LLM Ready)

## What counts as Stealth
- Stealth = actions to avoid or delay detection; priority is staying unnoticed, not gathering info or changing attitudes.
- Includes: quiet movement/hugging walls; hiding from sight; sneaking up; tailing unnoticed; covert entry/exit; staying low-profile in danger.
- Not Stealth: observing the environment (Exploration); talking guards into passage (Social); outright fleeing or chasing (Chase); explicit attacks (Combat).
- Quick test: if the goal is “they do not notice me,” it is Stealth.

## When to roll
- Roll only when detection is uncertain and failure would change the scene.
- No roll: no observers; environment clearly guarantees concealment; plot needs temporary unseen entry.
- Roll if any: nearby NPCs/creatures/sensors; sight/hearing/alarms present; terrain could expose; failure would trigger chase or combat.

## How to resolve
- Treat Stealth as a contest against perception even if implicit.
- Keeper should check: who could notice; are they alert or passive; does the environment favor stealth or exposure.
- Use Stealth vs observers’ Listen/Spot Hidden when apt; otherwise a standard Stealth check.

## Outcomes
- Success: remain unnoticed, gain positional advantage, choose next action (explore/social/ambush), delay conflict. Success alone does not grant extra info or attack bonuses beyond being unseen.
- Failure: detected, attention drawn, opponents go on alert, chase begins, or combat starts. Severity depends on failure level and opponents’ posture.

## Push rules
- Push allowed with a changed method (new route, slower pace, better cover).
- Push failure: immediate exposure, enemies seize initiative, become surrounded, stealth unusable for the scene.

## Time scale
- Instant: drop behind cover, crouch, hold breath; seconds; mostly reactions.
- Short Action: sneak across an area, approach or exit quietly; minutes; standard Stealth check unit affecting next move.
- Scene: extended lurking, tailing across blocks, infiltrating a building; whole scene; may need multiple Stealth checks; one failure can end stealth for that scene.

## Relevant skills
- Core: Stealth for quiet movement and concealment.
- Supporting: Listen/Spot Hidden to judge detection (from observers), Track for covert tailing, Disguise for static concealment or prep, Sleight of Hand for close-up covert acts, Climb/Jump to support stealth routes.
- Attribute substitutes allowed: DEX for agile movement, APP to blend in crowds, POW to maintain composure.
