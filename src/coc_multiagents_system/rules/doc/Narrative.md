# Narrative Rules (LLM Ready)

## What counts as Narrative
- Narrative = actions meant to move story, reveal character, or reshape scene state where dice results are not the point.
- Typically: emotional exchanges/flashbacks/arguments (not persuasion rolls); descriptive actions (arranging a room, writing, praying, monologue); scene transitions (arrive/leave/time jumps); aftermath processing; character growth or world-state declarations by the Keeper.
- Not Narrative: attempts to influence someone (Social); investigation for clues (Exploration); stealth/chase/combat; SAN checks for horror (Mental).
- Quick test: success/failure isn’t the focus—what changes in story is.

## When to roll
- Default: no roll. 7e principle—don’t roll everything. Use narration for interludes, inner thoughts, mood, scene shifts, Keeper world updates.
- Edge cases: only when explicitly seeking an effect (prayer for comfort → maybe POW; long rest to recover; reflection to derive meaning → INT/Psychology). These often border on Mental/Recovery, not pure Narrative.

## If a roll happens
- Keeper checks: is the action fitting for the character; does rolling disrupt tone/pace; would it steal meaning from other action types. Purpose of any roll is to add weight, not randomize story beats.

## Outcomes
- Narrative consequences are long-term/story-side, not numeric damage: relationship shifts, world-state changes (time, public opinion), tone shifts (hope/despair), sets stakes for future scenes, opens/closes plot branches. Often “nothing now, but everything is different later.”

## Push rules
- No Push for Narrative. If players want a second try for effect, shift to another action type (Social/Mental/Exploration).

## Time scale
- Instant: a line, expression, decision, cut; marks a key beat.
- Short: a short conversation, memory, or atmospheric description; deepens character/tempo.
- Scene: full interlude, chapter wrap, time skip, consequences montage; the common Narrative shape.

## Skills in Narrative
- Principle: Narrative doesn’t rely on skills. Skills may color narration (Psychology to describe insight; Occult/History for background; Art/Craft/Language for flavor; Credit Rating to show status) without rolling—they justify flavor, not success checks.
