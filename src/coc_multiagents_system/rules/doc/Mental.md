# Mental Rules (LLM Ready)

## What counts as Mental
- Mental = actions/reactions about bearing, resisting, or processing psychic/psychological impact—changing the internal state, not the external world.
- Includes: facing horrors or corpses; resisting mind control/hypnosis/domination; staying calm; digesting reality-breaking truths; responses to mental shock (panic, freeze); deliberate self-control (don’t scream/run).
- Not Mental: observing clues (Exploration); influencing others (Social); physical conflict (Combat); stealth or chase moves.
- Quick test: if the roll only changes the character’s mental state, it is Mental.

## When to roll
- Triggered by situation, not player request. Roll when: witnessing horror; uncovering worldview-shattering truth; under mental attack/control; acute psychological stress; already unstable and hit again. Keeper calls for the check; it cannot be opted out.

## Core check types
- `Sanity (SAN)`: how much horror erodes you; d100 ≤ current SAN = lighter impact, otherwise heavier loss and possible madness.
- `POW vs` or `POW check`: resist control, domination, psychic pressure—willpower contests for spells/abilities.
- `INT check`: whether you grasp the awful truth (e.g., after ≥5 SAN loss in one go); understanding can itself trigger madness.

## Outcomes
- Success: keep or lightly dent sanity, emotions waver but controlled, avoid immediate madness, can continue acting.
- Failure: SAN loss (long-term trend), temporary insanity, indefinite insanity, phobia/mania onset, short-term Keeper control of actions—directly reduces player control.

## Push rules
- Push generally not allowed; you cannot “try again to not be afraid.” Rare Keeper exception for self-calming or long recovery attempts, but default is no Push.

## Time scale
- Instant: SAN checks, POW contests, INT realizations, immediate madness reactions—happen inside other actions.
- Short Action: brief loss of control (scream/run/freeze), emotional swings, one Bout of Madness; lasts minutes or a few rounds.
- Scene/Long-term: enduring insanity, trauma, phobias/manias, long SAN decline; spans scenes and alters long-term behavior, needs rest/treatment.

## Skills and attributes
- Core attributes: SAN (tolerance), POW (will/mental defense), INT (comprehension).
- Supporting skills: Psychology (understand others), Psychoanalysis (long-term treatment/SAN recovery), Occult/Cthulhu Mythos (comprehend terror—at a cost), Medicine (support mental treatment).
- Principles: Social charms/acting don’t negate fear; skills cannot replace SAN checks.
