# Environmental Rules (LLM Ready)

## What counts as Environmental
- Environmental = outcomes driven by the environment itself; characters can only react/endure, not debate or fight an intelligent foe.
- Examples: collapse/falling floors; fire/explosion/electrical hazards; extreme weather; toxic gas/smoke/low oxygen; hazardous terrain (swamp/quicksand/slopes); mechanical failure (elevator, overload); ongoing environmental damage or stress.
- Framing: you are not opposing a mind—reality is the threat.

## When to roll
- Check only if the environment is threatening and the character is actively avoiding, enduring, or mitigating it, or if the danger is gradual/reactive.
- No roll: purely narrative change (rain starts but no impact yet); unavoidable effect (point-blank blast); plot requires the consequence—Keeper applies results directly.

## Resolution logic
- Goal is not binary success; it is about the cost you pay to face the environment.
- Even on success there may be cost; failure increases cost. Keeper sets danger level, duration, and whether actions can reduce impact.

## Outcomes
- Success: reduce/avoid damage, skirt worst area, delay impact, gain a short safety window—usually “less harm,” not “no harm.”
- Failure: HP loss, Major Wound, possible SAN check for catastrophic scenes, fatigue/ability drain, gear damage, forced route changes; often physical + mental hits.

## Push rules
- Push usually allowed but very high risk; requires choosing a riskier response knowing failure is worse.
- Push failure: severe injury, incapacitation, disaster escalation, collateral harm to others—this is a “bet your life” choice.

## Time scale
- Instant: dodge falling debris, evade blast, hold breath, grab a ledge; reactive, often a single roll embedded in other actions.
- Short Action: cross fire/smoke, operate in fumes, stabilize a shaking structure, quick fix on equipment; minutes under pressure, possibly multiple checks.
- Scene: blizzard trek, rescue in a fire, escape a ruined building, extended low-oxygen exposure; whole scene with accumulating checks and lasting consequences.

## Skills and attributes
- Core attributes: DEX (react/evade), CON (endure), STR (force through/support), POW (withstanding fear/stress).
- Common skills: Dodge; Climb/Jump/Swim; Mechanical Repair; Electrical Repair; First Aid/Medicine; Survival; Track (maintain direction in harsh conditions).
- Mental link: catastrophic environments often pair with SAN checks.
