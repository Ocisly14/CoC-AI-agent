## What counts as Exploration
- Exploration = actions whose primary intent is to gather information, find clues, or understand the environment (goal: know, not change).
- Treat as Exploration: searching rooms/items; inspecting bodies/traces; reading/studying books/files/records; observing for anomalies; cautious movement while examining unfamiliar areas; attempts to identify what a phenomenon is.
- Not Exploration: persuade/deceive/intimidate (Social); attack/defend/chase or functional actions like firing/throwing (Combat/Chase); pure movement without inquiry.
- Quick test: if the goal is "learn or discover" rather than "alter or affect," label it Exploration.

## When to roll
- Only roll when outcome is uncertain and has dramatic weight (CoC 7e principle).
- Plot-critical info (Obvious clue): no roll; give outright.
- Optional info: roll only if any are true-clue hidden, environment dangerous, time pressure, interference; otherwise provide without a roll.

## Difficulty benchmarks
- Regular: normal search, no interference.
- Hard: poor lighting, rushed, cluttered conditions.
- Extreme: very well-hidden targets or hazardous environments.

## On failure
- Failure != nothing.
- Obvious clues: still give; maybe vaguer or delayed; never block progress.
- Obscure clues: failure = missed for now; allow Push.
- Push: raises stakes; on failure apply a consequence such as minor harm (nail/cut), item damage, noise that attracts attention, hostile trigger, or extra time cost. Push allowed for Exploration, not for attack rolls.

## Time categories
- Instant (seconds-~1 min): quick glance/gut check; usually no roll or meaningful time cost.
- Short Action (minutes-~15 min): search a room, check a body, rummage furniture, listen; standard Exploration window.
- Scene/Extended (30+ min up to half/whole day): library research, reading diaries/tomes, full building sweep, studying mechanisms; can retry; expect external changes (NPC/time).

## Relevant skills
- Core: Spot Hidden; Listen; Library Use.
- Knowledge/analysis: History; Occult; Cthulhu Mythos; Law/Accounting; Medicine; Psychology.
- Physical/environment: Climb/Jump/Swim; Mechanical Repair; Electrical Repair; Track.
- If no skill fits, fall back to an attribute check (INT/EDU/DEX).
